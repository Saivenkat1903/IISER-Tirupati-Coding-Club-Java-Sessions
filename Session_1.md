# Session 1: General Introduction to Java

## Why Java?
Java is useful because it is a write once, run anywhere programming language. <br>
- Used in Android App development.
- Far easier than C/C++
- Object oriented.
- Used in App development, Web server development, game development.
- Cause I'm tired of coding Python everytime.

We hope theses sessions will make you comfortable enough with Java, so that we as a club can go onto Web development using Java, Android App development, etc.
