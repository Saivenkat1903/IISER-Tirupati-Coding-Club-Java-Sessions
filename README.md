# IISER-Tirupati-Coding-Club-Java-Sessions
This repository has the Java files and Session Minutes for the IISER Tirupati Coding Club Java Learning Series that is being conducted Spring 2023

## Structure of the GitHub
Each folder is related to a session. In each session folder, one will find the session markdown file which has a small summary of what happened that session.
Each session folder also contains the Java code which was used that session. The code is commented for you guys to understand and is downloadable for practice.

## Note
This is a public github and everyone of you can add/delete/edit files. I hope no one will misuse this and end up ruining the files that we have. That being said, everyone is welcome to add their own files and inputs as long as they don't disturb thee main files of the repo.
