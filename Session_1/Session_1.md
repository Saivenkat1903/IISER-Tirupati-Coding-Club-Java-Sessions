# Session 1: General Introduction to Java
Session 1 held on January 24th 2023 10:30pm - 12:00pm 

## Why Java?
Java is useful because it is a write once, run anywhere programming language. <br>
- Used in Android App development.
- Far easier than C/C++
- Object oriented.
- Used in App development, Web server development, game development.
- Cause I'm tired of coding Python everytime.

We hope theses sessions will make you comfortable enough with Java, so that we as a club can go onto Web development using Java, Android App development, etc.

## Goals for this Session
The topics covered for this sessions are; <br> 
- [ ] Set up a Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer.
- [ ] Write your first Java code (_Hello world_ for the nth time)
- [ ] Explain what Java is doing in the background. Understand the Java compiler.
- [ ] Understanding what is a **class**, **method** and **statement**.  
- [ ] Explaining Java Data Types
- [ ] Showing Syntax for Loops including *while* and *for*.
- [ ] If Time permits showcase what Python is hiding from you.
- [ ] Understanding **If-Else** statement and applying it.

### Reference Book
Head first Java - Highly recommended, very fun book

## Points to Keep in mind
- Java is popular due to the fact that code written in Java can be run in any computer despite it's hardware.
- Java code contains _classes_ which Contain _methods_ which contain _statements_.
- When running a Java program, Java automatically runs the _main_ methods in the class of the file.
- Java first compiles the code to **bytecode** before running it on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Data types of variables need to be declared in Java.
- Curly brackets and semicolons are **EXTREMELY** important.
- If-Else statements use Boolean Operators (Which we will get into later)
